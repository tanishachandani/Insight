{"summary": "**Overview**\n\nThe lecture introduces **NP-completeness** and **NP-hardness**, concepts used to classify computational problems based on their difficulty.\n\n**NP Problems**\n\n* Problems in **Nondeterministic Polynomial time (NP)** can be solved in polynomial time on a hypothetical nondeterministic computer.\n* **NP-Decision problems** ask whether there exists an object satisfying a polynomial time-checkable property.\n* **NP-Optimization problems** find the object that optimizes a polynomial time-computable objective.\n\n**Reductions**\n\n* A **reduction** from problem A to B demonstrates that if there is an algorithm for B, it can be used to solve A, implying that A is no harder than B.\n\n**NP-Completeness & NP-Hardness**\n\n* A problem is **NP-complete** if it is in NP and polynomial time reducible to every other problem in NP.\n* A problem is **NP-hard** if it is polynomial time reducible to an NP-complete problem.\n\n**Example Problems**\n\n* **Circuit SAT:** Given a circuit, determine if there is an input that gives an output of 1.\n* **Formula SAT:** Given a logical formula, determine if there is an assignment to the variables that makes the formula true.\n* **Hamiltonian Cycle:** Given a graph, determine if there is a cycle that visits every vertex exactly once.\n* **Zero-One Equations:** Given a system of linear equations with 0/1 coefficients, determine if there is a solution.\n\n**Brute Force Algorithms**\n\n* For many problems, there are inefficient brute force algorithms that consider every possible solution.\n* However, for some problems, such as Formula SAT and Hamiltonian Cycle, no efficient brute force algorithms are known.\n\n**P vs. NP**\n\n* The million-dollar question is whether **P = NP**, i.e., if every NP problem can be solved in polynomial time.\n* Most computer scientists believe that **P \u2260 NP**, suggesting that some NP problems are inherently difficult.\n\n**Hard Problems**\n\n* In practice, some NP problems have been shown to be difficult, even if no NP-hardness proof exists.\n* To determine the difficulty of a problem, one can either search for efficient algorithms, try to prove it is NP-hard, or try to relate its difficulty to that of other problems.\n\n**Other NP-Complete/Hard Problems**\n\n* Maximum Independent Set\n* Traveling Salesman Problem\n* Knapsack\n* The NP-hard versions of these problems are shown using reductions from other NP-hard or NP-complete problems.", "flash_cards": [["What is the name of the problem where a formula with boolean variables is given
