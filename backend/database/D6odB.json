    "summary": "**Overview: The Limits of Classical Computers and the Potential of Quantum Computing**\n\n**Classical Computers:**\n\n- Consist of simple components (data representation, processing, control) organized in hierarchical structures\n- Compute by manipulating bits (discrete units of information with values 0 or 1)\n- Combinations of bits represent more complex information\n- Compute by combining logic gates (e.g., AND Gates) to perform basic operations (e.g., addition)\n- As components shrink, quantum effects (e.g., quantum tunneling) become significant\n\n**Quantum Computers:**\n\n- Utilize qubits (quantum bits) that can exist in a superposition of states, representing both 0 and 1 simultaneously\n- Exploit superposition and entanglement (instantaneous connections between qubits)\n- Quantum gates manipulate qubits in superpositions and rotate probabilities\n- Final measurements collapse superpositions, producing a specific sequence of 0s and 1s\n- Provide exponential speed-ups compared to classical computers in certain areas (e.g., database searching)\n\n**Applications of Quantum Computers:**\n\n- **Database Searching:** Faster searching algorithms\n- **Cryptography:** Breaking current encryption systems\n- **Simulations:** Accurate simulations of quantum systems, including molecules",
