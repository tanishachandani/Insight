{"summary": "**Overview**\n\n* Quantum computers are a potential solution to the physical limits of traditional computers as they approach the atomic level.\n* Quantum computers exploit quantum properties to perform exponentially faster calculations.\n\n**Components of a Traditional Computer**\n\n* Made up of simple components performing basic functions:\n    * Representing data (bits)\n    * Processing data (transistors)\n    * Controlling operations (logic gates)\n\n**Transistors and Quantum Tunneling**\n\n* Transistors are switches that block or allow electrical signals.\n* As transistors shrink, quantum tunneling becomes a problem, causing electrons to bypass blocked passages.\n\n**Quantum Computers**\n\n* **Qubits:**\n    * Quantum equivalent of bits\n    * Can exist in superposition, representing multiple states simultaneously\n* **Superposition:**\n    * Enables exponential increases in possible combinations\n* **Entanglement:**\n    * Close connection between qubits, allowing instantaneous state changes\n\n**Quantum Gates:**\n\n* Manipulate probabilities and produce superpositions instead of definite outputs\n* Enable simultaneously calculating multiple possibilities, exponentially reducing computation time\n\n**Applications of Quantum Computers**\n\n* Database searching: Exponential speed advantage over traditional computers\n* Cryptography breaking: Can decrypt encrypted data exponentially faster\n* Simulations: Accurate simulations of complex quantum systems, such as molecules and proteins", "flash_cards": [["Transistor", "A switch in
