{"summary": "**Overview**\n\nThe limits of classical computation are approaching as computer components become smaller than atoms. Quantum computers offer a solution by exploiting the strange properties of quantum physics to perform complex computations exponentially faster than classical computers.\n\n**Quantum Computer Basics**\n\n* **Bits:** Classical computers have bits that can be either 0 or 1.\n* **Qubits:** Quantum computers use qubits, which can exist in both states simultaneously (superposition).\n* **Entanglement:** Qubits can be entangled, instantaneously affecting each other's states regardless of distance.\n\n**Quantum Gates**\n\n* **Function:** Quantum gates manipulate superpositions, rotate probabilities, and output a new superposition as a result.\n* **Unlike Classical Logic Gates:** Quantum gates output a probability distribution rather than a single definite value.\n\n**Advantages of Quantum Computers**\n\n* **Database Searching:** Exponential speed-up for searching large databases.\n* **Encryption Breaking:** Potential to break current encryption standards.\n* **Simulations:** Accurate simulations of quantum systems, including molecules.\n\n**Limitations**\n\n* **Measurement:** Measuring qubits causes collapse of superposition, yielding only one possible result.\n* **Error Correction:** Quantum computers are prone to errors, so multiple runs may be necessary.\n* **Specialized Use:** Quantum computers are not expected to replace classical computers but to excel in specific tasks.\n\n**Future Prospects**\n\n* **Unknown Potential:** The full potential of quantum computers is still unknown.\n* **Exploration:** Scientists are actively researching the possibilities and applications of quantum computing.", "flash_cards": [["Transistor", "The simplest form of a data processor in computers, basically a switch that can either block or open the way for information coming through."], ["Bit", "A unit of information that can be set to either 0 or 1.
